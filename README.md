# Epicenter

This is app handles a few different things for Epicodus students and staff, including:

* Tuition
* Attendance
* Code Reviews

It's designed to be flexible enough that other schools can adopt it with minimal changes.

Contributions from students, alumni, and other schools are welcome! If you're considering adding a feature, please open a Github issue to discuss it with the project's maintainers first.


## Configuration

Epicenter uses several environmental variables loaded from the `.env` file.
An example `.env.example` file is provided; you should copy it to `.env` and
update the example values.
